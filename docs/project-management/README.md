# Project Management Documentation

Simple project management setup for the Ausuka.ai mod repository.

## Issue Templates

- **ü§ñ AI-Driven** - Simple template where users describe their ideas in natural language
- **üêõ Bug Report** - Standard bug reporting with version info
- **üîß Enhancement** - Improvements to existing features  
- **‚ú® Feature Request** - New feature suggestions
- **‚ùì Q&A** - Questions about the mod

## Automation

### AI Processing
- Automatically processes AI-driven issues
- Converts natural language to structured formats
- Uses Python for reliable text processing

### Issue-PR Linking
- Enforces "Closes #XXX" format in PRs
- Maintains 1:1 relationship between issues and PRs

### Weekly Management
- Archives closed issues weekly
- Marks issues stale after 6 months
- Generates project health reports

## Labels

### Types
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - Improvement to existing functionality  
- `feature-request` - New functionality request
- `question` - Questions needing answers

### Priority (p0-p4)
- `p0` - Critical (security, data loss)
- `p1` - High priority (major features/bugs)
- `p2` - Medium priority (normal work)
- `p3` - Low priority (nice to have)
- `p4` - Lowest (future considerations)

### Status
- `needs-triage` - Needs initial review
- `needs-info` - Waiting for more information
- `in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `blocked` - Blocked by dependencies
- `stale` - No recent activity

## For Contributors

1. **Creating Issues**: Use the AI-driven template - just describe what you're thinking
2. **Creating PRs**: Must link to an issue using "Closes #XXX" format
3. **Questions**: Use the Q&A template for help

## For AI Agents

See `AGENTS.md` for comprehensive PR creation guidelines including:
- Required issue linking
- Title formats (fix:, feat:, enhance:, etc.)
- Testing requirements
- i18n considerations

## Examples

### Good Issue Title
- `[AI] The mod should remember my building preferences`
- `[Bug] AI crashes when teleporting to saved location`
- `[Feature] Add inventory sorting command`

### Good PR Title  
- `fix: Resolve AI crash during teleportation (Closes #123)`
- `feat: Add inventory sorting command (Closes #124)`
- `enhance: Improve AI response speed (Closes #125)`
- **Sprint** (Text): Current sprint/milestone identifier

### 2. Required Secrets

Configure the following repository secrets:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key        # For AI processing (optional)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key    # Alternative to OpenAI (optional)
```

**Note:** AI processing will fall back to rule-based classification if no API keys are provided.

### 3. Project URL Configuration

Update the project URL in `project-management.yml`:

```yaml
project-url: https://github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER
```

### 4. Label Setup

**Priority Labels:**
- `priority:high` (red)
- `priority:medium` (orange)
- `priority:low` (yellow)

**Area Labels:**
- `area:ai` (purple)
- `area:admin` (brown)

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Creating Issues:**
   - Use specific templates for known issue types
   - Use the AI-driven template for natural language descriptions
   - Provide as much detail as possible

2. **AI-Driven Issues:**

   - Merge PR to automatically close the issue

### For Maintainers

1. **Weekly Cycles:**
   - Automated weekly summaries are generated
   - Completed items are tracked and archived
   - Project metrics are calculated automatically

2. **Manual Intervention:**
   - Use `workflow_dispatch` to trigger specific actions
   - Review AI-processed issues for accuracy
   - Manage stale issues and PRs
