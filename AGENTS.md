## Coding style
1. When writing code, please make sure to keep the code elegant and reusable.
2. When you are modifying existing code, if you find that some code is not elegant, unreasonable, or does not meet the reusability requirements, you should be responsible for refactoring them instead of adapting to them.
3. Do not use fully qualified class names, etc., and use the most elegant way
4. When you write code, comments should be in English
